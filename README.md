# GO Game Server

This project was started to explore programming in an environment where performance is crucial.

I might start new repositories to experiment with different architectures, or update this one as I go.

A Unity client is developed along side the server, but I don't intend to release that soon. My C# isn't very good and it's only purpose is a front to this server.
